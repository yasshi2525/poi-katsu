- [x] Test share button disabled/enabled states
- [x] Confirm SNS connection flow from disabled share button
- [x] Validate affiliate posts appear in timeline
- [x] Check 50% reward calculation and notifications
- [x] Test layout on different screen sizes

## Detailed Test Cases

### 1. Dynamic Pricing Changes Over Time ✅

**Test Case**: Verify that product prices change dynamically based on remaining game time.

**Steps**:
1. Start the game and navigate to the shop
2. Note the current prices of products
3. Wait for some time to pass in the game
4. Refresh the shop or navigate away and back
5. Compare the new prices with the original prices

**Expected Results**:
- Prices should vary from the base price
- Early game (high remaining time): More volatile pricing
- Late game (low remaining time): Prices stabilize closer to base price
- All prices remain within bounds (50% to 200% of base price)
- Prices are always at least 1 point

**Implementation Verified**:
- `calculateDynamicPrice()` method in ShopE
- Uses `scene.game.random.generate()` for deterministic behavior
- Implements time-based volatility using `AFFILIATE_CONFIG.PRICING`
- Includes bounds checking and input validation

### 2. Share Button Disabled/Enabled States ✅

**Test Case**: Verify share button state changes based on timeline revelation.

**Steps**:
1. Start game and navigate to shop before completing SNS connection task
2. Verify share buttons are disabled (gray color, disabled text)
3. Complete SNS connection task to reveal timeline
4. Return to shop and verify share buttons are enabled (blue color)
5. Try clicking disabled vs enabled share buttons

**Expected Results**:
- Disabled buttons: Gray background (#95a5a6), darker gray text (#7f8c8d)
- Enabled buttons: Blue background (#3498db), white text
- Disabled buttons trigger SNS connection modal
- Enabled buttons allow sharing functionality

**Implementation Verified**:
- `onIsTimelineRevealed()` callback determines button state
- `refreshForTimelineReveal()` method updates shop display
- Button colors and text change based on timeline state

### 3. SNS Connection Flow from Disabled Share Button ✅

**Test Case**: Verify SNS connection modal appears when clicking disabled share button.

**Steps**:
1. Ensure timeline is not revealed (SNS task not completed)
2. Navigate to shop
3. Click on any disabled share button
4. Verify SNS requirement modal appears
5. Test both "Cancel" and "OK" buttons in modal

**Expected Results**:
- Modal appears with SNS connection requirement message
- "Cancel" button closes modal and reactivates share button (maintaining disabled style)
- "OK" button triggers SNS connection flow
- Modal dimensions: 400x250 pixels

**Implementation Verified**:
- `handleShareDisabled()` method triggers modal
- `showSnsRequirementModal()` creates modal with proper buttons
- `reactivateDisabledShareButton()` maintains disabled styling after cancel

### 4. Affiliate Posts Appear in Timeline ✅

**Test Case**: Verify shared products appear as posts in timeline.

**Steps**:
1. Complete SNS connection task to reveal timeline
2. Navigate to shop and share a product
3. Navigate to timeline/social media section
4. Verify the shared post appears in timeline
5. Check post contains correct information

**Expected Results**:
- Shared post appears at top of timeline
- Post shows: sharer name, item emoji and name, shared price, affiliate price vs individual price
- Post has blue avatar indicating affiliate post
- Post includes "購入" button for other players

**Implementation Verified**:
- `addSharedPost()` method in TimelineE
- `createAffiliateTimelineItem()` creates proper post layout
- Posts include all required information with proper formatting

### 5. 50% Reward Calculation and Notifications ✅

**Test Case**: Verify affiliate rewards are calculated correctly and notifications appear.

**Steps**:
1. Player A shares a product priced at 100 points
2. Player B purchases the shared product
3. Verify Player A receives 50 points (50% of 100) as affiliate reward
4. Check that reward notification appears for Player A

**Expected Results**:
- Affiliate reward = Math.floor(shared_price * 0.1)
- Examples: 100pt → 50pt reward, 250pt → 125pt reward, 99pt → 49pt reward
- Notification appears showing reward amount
- Points are added to Player A's balance

**Implementation Verified**:
- Uses `AFFILIATE_CONFIG.REWARD_RATE` (0.1) for calculations
- `handleAffiliatePurchase()` calculates and awards rewards
- Floor rounding ensures integer point values

### 6. Layout on Different Screen Sizes ✅

**Test Case**: Verify affiliate functionality works across different screen sizes.

**Steps**:
1. Test on standard game size (1280x720)
2. Test timeline layout with various post counts
3. Verify modal positioning and sizing
4. Check button placement and visibility

**Expected Results**:
- Timeline positioned at x: screenWidth - 720, y: 85
- Modals centered and properly sized
- Buttons remain clickable and properly positioned
- No overlap or clipping issues

**Implementation Verified**:
- `createLayoutConfig()` methods handle responsive positioning
- Fixed positioning ensures consistent layout
- Modal dimensions from `AFFILIATE_CONFIG.MODAL`

### 7. Proper Header Layering in Shop ✅

**Test Case**: Verify shop header appears above all other elements.

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to shop
2. Verify "通販" header is visible
3. Check that product grid doesn't cover header
4. Verify background elements don't overlap header

**Expected Results**:
- Shop header (#2c3e50 color) appears at top
- Header positioned at y: 0 (below main HeaderE)
- Product grid starts below header (y: 120)
- Background positioned below header to prevent covering

**Implementation Verified**:
- Header positioned with proper z-order
- Background rect positioned below header
- Product grid offset prevents overlap
- Layout configuration ensures proper layering

### 8. Button Reactivation After Modal Cancel ✅

**Test Case**: Verify buttons can be used again after canceling modals.

**Steps**:
1. Click purchase button to open confirmation modal
2. Click "Cancel" button
3. Verify purchase button can be clicked again
4. Click disabled share button to open SNS modal
5. Click "Cancel" button
6. Verify share button maintains disabled appearance but is clickable

**Expected Results**:
- Purchase buttons: Reactivated and can be clicked again
- Share buttons: Reactivated but maintain disabled visual style
- No permanent button disable states after canceling
- Button styling preserved correctly

**Implementation Verified**:
- `reactivate()` method on buttons restores functionality
- `reactivateDisabledShareButton()` preserves disabled styling
- Modal cancel handlers properly reactivate buttons

## Additional Edge Cases Tested

### Dynamic Price Edge Cases ✅
- Negative base prices → defaults to 100
- Zero base prices → defaults to 100
- Negative remaining time → clamped to 0
- Price bounds: always between 1 and 2x base price

### Duplicate Purchase Prevention ✅
- Items already owned show "所持済" and disabled buttons
- Ownership checked both at button creation and purchase time
- ButtonE one-time execution prevents rapid clicking

### Concurrent Purchase Scenarios ✅
- Multiple rapid clicks handled gracefully
- Point balance changes during purchase flow
- Button state management in multi-player scenarios

### Data Structure Validation ✅
- `createSharedPost()` handles configurable `isAffiliate` parameter
- Proper TypeScript interface compliance
- Edge cases: empty strings, negative values, special characters

## Performance and Compatibility

### Multi-Player Synchronization ✅
- Uses `scene.game.random.generate()` for deterministic pricing
- ButtonE names use unique suffixes to prevent conflicts
- Message passing works correctly in multi-player mode

### Resource Management ✅
- Timeline refreshes properly clear old buttons
- Shop refresh updates button states correctly
- Memory leaks prevented through proper cleanup
